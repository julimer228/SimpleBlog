# SimpleBlog
This was a project for my studies. It is an application to create posts on the blog. First I have to create a console application according to Model View Controller architectural pattern. Next I had to write unit tests.
The next step was to create a simple web application running on Payara Server. In the first folder you can find the console version and in the second folder you can find the web application.
